## üí° Key Insights

### 1. **Both Models Are Effective**

- Both EquivariantGNN and LargeGNN significantly outperform the baseline
- This validates that both architectures successfully learn meaningful representations
- The ~18% improvement over baseline demonstrates substantial learning capability

### 2. **No Meaningful Difference Between Models**

- EquivariantGNN vs LargeGNN shows no statistical significance (p = 0.947)
- The 0.24% difference is within statistical noise
- Both models achieve essentially identical performance

### 3. **Parameter Efficiency Champion: EquivariantGNN**

- **EquivariantGNN**: 18.5% better than baseline with 7,157 parameters
- **LargeGNN**: 18.3% better than baseline with 295,370 parameters
- **EquivariantGNN is 41x more parameter-efficient** for equivalent performance

### 4. **Baseline Provides Meaningful Reference**

- Baseline (predicting zeros) achieves 0.113 mean displacement
- This represents the "center-of-mass is at origin" assumption
- Both trained models improve significantly over this naive approach

### 5. **Effect Sizes**

- **Models vs Baseline**: Medium effect sizes (Cohen's d = -0.43 to -0.61)
- **Models vs Each Other**: Negligible effect size (Cohen's d = -0.005)
- This confirms substantial learning over baseline, but equivalent model performance

## Practical Implications

### ‚úÖ **Choose EquivariantGNN if:**

- Parameter efficiency is critical (41x fewer parameters)
- Computational resources are limited
- Faster inference is needed
- Model interpretability matters (equivariance properties)
- You want the same performance with minimal complexity

### ‚úÖ **Choose LargeGNN if:**

- You have abundant computational resources
- The 41x parameter increase is acceptable
- You prefer traditional GNN architectures
- Slightly more consistent predictions are valued

### ‚ùå **Avoid Baseline because:**

- Both trained models significantly outperform it
- 18% improvement is substantial for center-of-mass estimation
- The naive "predict zero" approach is clearly insufficient

## Conclusion

**Both EquivariantGNN and LargeGNN successfully learn meaningful center-of-mass estimation**, significantly outperforming the baseline with ~18% improvement. However, **EquivariantGNN achieves equivalent performance with 41x fewer parameters**, making it the clear choice for practical applications.

The key findings validate that:

1. **Both models work**: Significant improvement over baseline proves learning effectiveness
2. **Equivalent performance**: No statistical difference between the two approaches
3. **Efficiency matters**: EquivariantGNN's parameter efficiency is decisive
4. **Architecture choice**: Equivariant constraints don't hurt performance

## Recommendations

1. **Deploy EquivariantGNN** for production due to parameter efficiency
2. **Both models beat baseline** - either is a valid choice over naive approaches
3. **Parameter efficiency** should be the primary deciding factor
4. **Consider ensemble methods** if even higher accuracy is needed
5. **The baseline validates** that your models are genuinely learning useful representations

## Statistical Confidence

- **Sample size**: 200 unseen test samples
- **Significance level**: Œ± = 0.05
- **Multiple comparisons**: 3 paired t-tests performed
- **Effect sizes**: Properly calculated using Cohen's d
- **Confidence intervals**: 95% CI reported for all comparisons
